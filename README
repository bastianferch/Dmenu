== Dynamic Menu for Garmin CIQ

DMenu.mc is an implementation of a dynamic menu where the menu ordering and length can be changed and an optional value line can be shown below the menu item name.  

It is similar to how the Alarm Clock menu (menu -> Clock -> Alarm Clock) works. The only feature not supported is showing a status icon.

This has only been tested on a fenix3 and on the simulator (for a fenix3), although I don't think there is any device specific code.

One thing I noticed in the simulator is if the ANIM_TIME constant is made 0.2 then there are drawing errors but on the actual watch there are none.

There are no copyright or licensing terms and you are free to use it as you wish, but at your own risk.

A rather trivial app is included to demonstrate its use.
